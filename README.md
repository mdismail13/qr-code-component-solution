It uses semantic HTML and CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout and styling.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced using semantic HTML and CSS Flex-box and Grid to build a clean and responsive QR code component.  
I learned how to center elements using CSS Grid and how to use Google Fonts for better typography.

Example of HTML used:

```html
<main>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code linking to Frontend Mentor site" />
    <h3 class="heading outfit-font">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h3>
    <p class="description outfit-font">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</main>
```
```css
.card {
  background-color: white;
  max-width: 320px;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 20px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development
I want to improve my skills in CSS animations and transitions to make components more interactive.
Also, I plan to learn more about accessibility features to make my projects more user-friendly.
